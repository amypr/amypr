### The Treasure Hunter Board Game

## Game Story 
Four unfortunate beings have been stranded in a jungle, and the only major landmark they can see is a temple. Hopefully, once they reach it, they will find some tourists to help them. On the way, they find curious treasures that they can trade with locals to help them in their journey. After each player has had a turn to make a move (by rolling dice), they will be mysteriously sucked into a minigame to play against each other for the promise of more treasure, and the treasure will be delegated to the players according to the outcome of the minigame. Whoever reaches the temple first will get to escape!

The main entry of our game is a board where players take turns rolling a die. Any player landing on certain tiles will trigger minigames or other random events. Both players will get into the minigames and compete with each other. They will collect treasures by achieving certain goals. They can use treasures to buy props to move faster on the board or gain certain capabilities in the next minigame. The player who reaches the temple first will gain the most treasure and the game will end, itâ€™s possible that this bonus is not enough and they may still lose to another player with more treasures.
